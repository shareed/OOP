# CREATE JAVA APPLICATION TEMPLATE
**Three layers for MVC design pattern**
- **Model** to present data to the user from backend (Ex. Model Class)
    -  a model to represent any entities in your application

- **View** how the model is presented to the user (Ex. using JSP)
    -  a JSP which will handle the View information using HTML  

- **Controller** manages data exchange between the view and the model
    - Servlet, performs the needed operations to get data from the backend(model) to the front(views)
