# Java 
- a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible
-  intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. 
- applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
