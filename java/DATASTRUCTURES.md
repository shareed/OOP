# DataStructures
## Array
- An object which contains elements of a similar data type
- It is a data structure where we store similar elements
- We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
- index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0 index.

**Advantages**
- Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
- Random access: We can get any data located at an index position
**Disadvantages**
- Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically. 

**Types of Array**
- Single Dimensional Array
- Multidimensional Array
